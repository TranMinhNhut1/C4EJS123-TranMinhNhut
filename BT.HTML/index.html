    <p> "Mary Oliver is saving my life,"Paul Chowder , the title  character of Nicholson Bakers novel"<a href="#">The Anthologist,</a>" scrawls in the margins of Oliver's <a href="#">"New and Selected Poems, Volume One."</a>. A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case off writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight year ,hass just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long -overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turn to poet who have his touchstones- Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver . In her work, he finds consolation:"I immediately felt more sure of what i was doing." Of her poems , he says, "They're very simple . And yet each has something."

    I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
    I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
    into the grass , how to kneel down in the grass,
    how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
    which is what I have been doing all day.
